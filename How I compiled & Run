That's a qt project, and I did not used qt designer.
So, I've always compiled the program on terminal.

To be practical, I created the below script line to compile and run the project automatically.

qmake -project && echo "QT += network" >> Currency-Converter.pro && qmake Currency-Converter.pro && make && ./Currency-Converter

Add a '&' in the end to open the program in the background (not connected to terminal)

the line "QT += network" had to be appended on the .pro file, in order to use QNetworkAccessManager (to connect to and fetch data from api.fixer.io)


Program can be rebuild with that command, if interested.

The required files for that purpose are below:

main.cpp defs.h
currencyConverter.h and currencyConverter.cpp
currencyButton.h and currencyButton.cpp
rateReader.h and rateReader.cpp
